<h2>Disclamer</h2>
<p>This app is on a very very very experimental release, I uploaded it because I will format my pc in a few days. Things like error handling, code cleaness and such may be a bit awful on this release.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The app only works for Windows 10 at the moment, in a future I will add proper Linux and macOS support.</p>

<h2>Supported Formats</h2>
